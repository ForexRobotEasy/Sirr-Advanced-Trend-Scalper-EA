# Sirr Advanced Trend Scalper EA

This is the code for the Sirr Advanced Trend Scalper EA, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This EA is designed to trade in the forex market using a combination of indicators including Stochastic, RSI, and MACD.

## How it Works

The EA works by first checking if the spread is within an acceptable range. If the spread is too high, the EA will not take any action. 

Next, it checks if the current price is within a specified range. If the price is not within this range, the EA will not take any action.

The EA then calculates the values of the Stochastic, RSI, and MACD indicators.

If the conditions for opening a new order are met (Stochastic value > 80, RSI value > 70, and MACD value > 0), the EA will check if the target price, spread, and fluctuations are favorable. If they are, it will place a buy order.

On the other hand, if the conditions for opening a new order are met (Stochastic value < 20, RSI value < 30, and MACD value < 0), the EA will check if the target price, spread, and fluctuations are favorable. If they are, it will place a sell order.
